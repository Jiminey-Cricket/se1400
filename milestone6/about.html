                    <h2>We're just a couple of simple nerds who love rolling dice, telling stories, and helping people find their first character sheets without panicking. We made this site because starting D&amp;D can feel overwhelming, and we wanted somewhere friendly to point new players so they can jump in and have fun — no lofty manuals or secret handshakes required.</h2>
                    <h2>Expect plain explanations, some bugs here and there, and resources we actually used when we were getting started. If you have questions or a weird character idea, we're happy to hear it — building a game is better with friends.</h2>
                    <h2>We appreciate all who use our website, since it is just as basic as it could possibly get. However, we put a lot of love into making it, and all we want to do is help others out with it as a resource.</h2>
