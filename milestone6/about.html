                    <h2>I'm just a simple nerd who loves rolling dice, telling stories, and helping people find their first character sheets without panicking. I made this site because starting D&amp;D can feel overwhelming, and I wanted somewhere friendly to point new players so they can jump in and have fun — no lofty manuals or secret handshakes required.</h2>
                    <h2>My guides are built from my own experiences playing the game for the first time as a group and the confusion I faced along the way. I hope that through me, players who are just starting out can learn D&amp;D's fundamentals much better than I had.</h2>
                    <h2>Expect plain explanations, some bugs here and there, and resources I actually used when I was getting started. If you have questions or a weird character idea, I'm happy to hear it — building a game is better with friends.</h2>
                    <h2>I appreciate all who use my website, since it is just as basic as it could possibly get. However, I put a lot of love into making it, and all I want to do is help others out with it as a resource.</h2>
