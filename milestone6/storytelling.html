                <h2>In order to be a good narrator, you must be actively engaged to the story and your players, and you must have a layout of the general campaign.</h2>
                <h2>To be activley engaged means to place yourself into the campaign and to describe every important detail that's happening. Be like the storyteller to your players, and try to help them understand the weights of their actions - either if it's utterly stupid of them to do or if it has immense weight to the campaign.</h2>
                <h2>Having the layout of your campaign means to write out your campaign - if it's original - or to have studied up on a campaign you plan on running with your group. You need to understand the different interactions between your players and key characters, the path your players must take, and if you can, incorporate side stories that are rooted from your player's backstories to add more depth.</h2>
                <h2>The goal of this guide is to not only give you more experience in being a good Dungeon Master and storyteller, but to help your players have a good time the whole way through. Don't be nervous, just be as genuine about the work you put into the story as you are with what your players do on the fly.</h2>
